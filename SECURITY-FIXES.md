# Production-Ready Security and Performance Fixes

This document summarizes all the critical fixes implemented to make the Sora Video Generator production-ready.

## Overview

All 7 priority fixes have been successfully implemented with production-quality code, comprehensive error handling, and proper TypeScript types.

---

## Priority 1: Security Fixes

### 1. Fixed API Key Security Issue

**Problem**: API keys were stored in client-side React state and localStorage, creating a critical security vulnerability.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` for secure session management
- API keys are now encrypted using libsodium and stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Cookies cannot be accessed by client-side JavaScript
- Session route provides POST, GET, and DELETE endpoints for key management
- Updated `StoryboardEditor.tsx` to remove API keys from component state after saving
- Updated `/api/video/generate/route.ts` to retrieve keys from session cookies

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/api/video/generate/route.ts` (modified)
- `/src/app/components/StoryboardEditor.tsx` (modified)

**Security Features**:
- HTTP-only cookies (prevents XSS attacks)
- Secure flag in production (HTTPS only)
- SameSite=lax (CSRF protection)
- 7-day cookie expiration
- Server-side encryption using libsodium
- API keys never exposed to client after initial save

---

### 2. Added Input Validation with Zod

**Problem**: API routes accepted user input without validation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/lib/validation.ts` with comprehensive Zod schemas
- Added validation for all request types:
  - Video generation requests
  - Session creation requests
  - Scene data
  - Character profiles
- Created `validateRequest` helper function for consistent validation
- All API routes now validate input and return proper error messages

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/lib/validation.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/api/video/generate/route.ts` (modified)
- `/src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` (uses validation)

**Validation Features**:
- Type-safe validation with Zod
- Detailed error messages for validation failures
- UUID validation for IDs
- String length limits to prevent abuse
- Enum validation for provider and status fields
- URL validation for video/image URLs

---

### 3. Fixed Memory Leak in Polling

**Problem**: The `pollVideoStatus` function created recursive setTimeout calls that were never cleaned up.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/src/app/hooks/usePolling.ts` custom hook
- Implements AbortController for request cancellation
- Tracks all active polling operations
- Properly cleans up timeouts and abort controllers
- Implements exponential backoff (starts at 2s, max 30s)
- Cleanup on component unmount
- Ability to stop individual or all polling operations

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/src/app/hooks/usePolling.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/components/StoryboardEditor.tsx` (modified to use hook)

**Features**:
- Exponential backoff with configurable multiplier
- Maximum attempts limit (default 60)
- AbortController for request cancellation
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Per-operation tracking by ID
- Error handling with callbacks

---

### 4. Fixed Race Condition in Scene Updates

**Problem**: `updateScene` used array index, but scenes could be deleted while video was processing.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed `updateScene` to use scene ID instead of index
- Changed `deleteScene` to use scene ID instead of index
- Updated `generateVideo` to use scene IDs
- Updated `pollVideoStatus` to use scene IDs
- Polling automatically stops when scene is deleted
- All scene operations now immune to index changes

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/app/components/StoryboardEditor.tsx`

**Race Condition Prevention**:
- Scene IDs remain constant even when scenes are reordered
- Polling uses scene ID to find current scene
- Deleting a scene automatically stops its polling
- No stale closures over scene indices

---

## Priority 2: Error Handling

### 5. Added Error Boundary Component

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/src/app/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Catches React errors and prevents full app crashes
- Displays user-friendly error UI
- Shows detailed error info in development mode
- Provides "Try Again" and "Reload Page" buttons
- Includes `withErrorBoundary` HOC wrapper
- Wrapped `StoryboardEditor` in `page.tsx`

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/src/app/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (new)
- `/src/app/page.tsx` (modified)

**Features**:
- Graceful error recovery
- User-friendly error display
- Development-mode stack traces
- Custom fallback support
- Error logging to console (ready for Sentry integration)

---

### 6. Fixed localStorage SSR Issues

**Problem**: localStorage was accessed during SSR causing hydration errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/src/app/hooks/useSafeLocalStorage.ts` custom hook
- Only accesses localStorage on client-side
- Implements debounced saves (default 500ms)
- Handles quota exceeded errors gracefully
- Provides loading state during hydration
- Error callbacks for monitoring

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/src/app/hooks/useSafeLocalStorage.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/components/StoryboardEditor.tsx` (modified to use hook)

**Features**:
- SSR-safe with proper hydration handling
- Debounced saves to reduce write frequency
- Quota exceeded error handling
- Parse error recovery
- Custom serializer/deserializer support
- Loading state during initialization
- Remove function for clearing storage

---

## Priority 3: Code Quality

### 7. Added Environment Variable Validation

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `/lib/env.ts` with Zod schema for all env vars
- Validates ENCRYPTION_KEY format (must be base64-encoded 32 bytes)
- Validates URLs (REDIS_URL, DATABASE_URL, etc.)
- Provides default values where appropriate
- Exports validated `env` object for type-safe access
- Fails fast on startup if configuration is invalid

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/lib/env.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` (uses validated env)
- `.env.local.example` (new, for setup guidance)

**Features**:
- Type-safe environment variable access
- Validation on startup
- Clear error messages for missing/invalid vars
- Helper functions: `isProduction`, `isDevelopment`, `isTest`
- Base64 validation for encryption key
- URL validation for service endpoints

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

All required dependencies are already in `package.json`:
- `zod` - for validation
- `libsodium-wrappers` - for encryption
- `uuid` - for ID generation

### 2. Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Generate an encryption key:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```
3. Add the generated key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key-here
   ```
4. Configure other variables as needed

### 3. Testing the Fixes

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test API key security:
   - Enter an API key and click "Save"
   - Verify it's stored in an HTTP-only cookie (check DevTools > Application > Cookies)
   - Verify the key is cleared from component state

3. Test polling cleanup:
   - Start a video generation
   - Navigate away or delete the scene
   - Verify no console errors and polling stops

4. Test localStorage SSR:
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify no hydration errors in console
   - Verify storyboard data persists

5. Test error boundary:
   - Simulate an error (modify code temporarily)
   - Verify error boundary displays friendly UI instead of crashing

## Production Deployment Notes

### Before Deploying:

1. **Set ENCRYPTION_KEY**: Generate a new key for production and add to hosting platform environment variables
2. **Enable HTTPS**: The session cookies will only be secure over HTTPS in production
3. **Configure Redis**: Ensure REDIS_URL points to production Redis instance
4. **Review Cookie Settings**: Adjust cookie expiration time if needed in `/src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts`
5. **Error Monitoring**: Consider integrating Sentry or similar service in ErrorBoundary component

### Security Considerations:

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** to version control
2. **Rotate ENCRYPTION_KEY** if ever compromised
3. **Use strong Redis passwords** in production
4. **Enable rate limiting** on API routes (not implemented in this update)
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies

## Performance Improvements

- Debounced localStorage saves (reduces I/O)
- Exponential backoff for polling (reduces server load)
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- useCallback for memoized functions
